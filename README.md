# Natural-Language-Tecnologies
Exercises for Natural-Language-Tecnologies Msc course at University of Turin.

On this course, basic elements on modern technologies for Natural Language Processing are proposed. 
There are three main components:
- in the first part the basics of natural language processing will be given, with special focus on: morphology, syntax, formal semantics, NL generation and automatic translation,
- the second one is mostly focussed on Lexical Semantics; several approaches for Knowledge Representation will be introduced herein, along with the notion of semantics based on conceptual anchoring. Also a detailed survey on the existing, state-of-the-art, semantic resources will be provided,
- the third one is oriented to statistical approaches to NLP, starting from the concept of distributional semantics and the existing methodologies. Then it will focus on the notion of semantic similarity and the theoretical bases for the construction of meaning through syntactic-semantic compositions, with an emphasis on the automatic construction of ontologies
